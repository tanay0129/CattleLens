    "Use glass-morphism effects with backdrop filters (12-24px blur)",
    "You MUST NOT apply universal transition. Eg: transition: all. This results in breaking transforms. Always add transitions for specific interactive elements like button, input excluding transforms",
    "You MUST NOT center align the app container, ie do not add .App { text-align: center; } in the css file. This disrupts the human natural reading flow of text",
    "Always use modern button styles like pill-shaped, or sharp button with interaction animations & color relevant to the app style",
    "NEVER: use AI assistant Emoji characters like 🤖🧠💭💡🔮🎯📚🎭🎬🎪🎉🎊🎁🎀🎂🍰🎈🎨🎰💰💵💳🏦💎🪙💸🤑📊📈📉💹🔢🏆🥇 etc for icons.",
    "Every interaction needs micro-animations - hover states, transitions, parallax effects, and entrance animations. Static = dead.",

    "Subtle grain textures, noise overlays, custom cursors, selection states, and loading animations: separates good from extraordinary.",

The 'Accent' color is your key to guiding the user's eye. The 'Upload Zone' is the most important component—make it huge, inviting, and interactive. Use the 'Scanning Overlay' effect when the API is called."
